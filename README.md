## Introduction
Xingxiang Huang

He/him/his

1st Year Master of *Civil and Environmental Engineering*

Concentrating on *Transportation Engineering*
## Course Description and Learning Objectives
This course introduces the foundations of spatial data science, focusing on how we can turn the overwhelming amount of data in todayâ€™s world into meaningful narratives and spatial insights. As a transportation engineering student, I think this class can help me explore how spatial analysis can address real-world challenges like traffic congestion, public transit accessibility, and urban mobility planning. 
## Project Ideas
Analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of bike-sharing usage to identify hotspots and peak times. Evaluate the accessibility and equity of this transport pattern.
