1st Year Master of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Concentrating on *Transportation Engineering*
## Course Description
This course introduces the foundations of spatial data science, focusing on how we can turn the overwhelming amount of data in todayâ€™s world into meaningful narratives and spatial insights. As a transportation engineering student, I think this class can help me explore how spatial analysis can address real-world challenges like traffic congestion, public transit accessibility, and urban mobility planning. 
# Project Ideas
1. Analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of bike-sharing usage to identify hotspots and peak times.\
2. Explore how urban factors like population density and land use affect bike-sharing demand.\
3. Evaluate the system's accessibility and equity to propose improvements for underserved areas.\
